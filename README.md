# Real-Time Talking and Singing Classification

This project is a **real-time audio classification system** that uses a trained neural network to distinguish between talking and singing from live audio input. The application is implemented using **Python**, **Streamlit**, and various audio processing libraries.

## Features

- **Real-Time Audio Input**: Captures audio in real-time using a microphone.
- **Classification**: Predicts whether the audio is talking or singing with high confidence.
- **Customizable Background**: Upload and crop a background image with adjustable zoom levels for the app interface.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with Streamlit for a clean and interactive user experience.
